# CVE-2022-22972
See <blog> for a detailed explanation.

This script can be used by bypass authentication on VMware Workspace ONE Access, Identity manager, and vRealize Automation using CVE-2022-22972. However, it has only been tested against vRealize Automation 7.6.

This script works by changing the Host header of a HTTP POST request of a VMware authentication endpoint to a Host controlled by an attacker. This causes the VMware application to reach out to the Host with credential information and if the Host returns 200, the user is successfully authenticated.

This script results in a HZN cookie which can be included with later requests to perform actions as the compromised user.

Default args will send the authentication request to our API gateway. You can change this with the `--host` option.
